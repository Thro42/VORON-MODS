# Dragonfly BMO Fan Duct
This Fan Duct for the Dragonfly BMO, is designed to improve the quality of PLA prints in the Afterburner. It is a remix of the Fan Duc from the original CAD file of the [Voron Afterburner](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Afterburner) and inspiert bei the [Halo Duct](https://github.com/tsitalon1/VoronUsers/tree/master/HaloDuct) from James Gillette. I share also my CAD file so, feel free to create your own version
